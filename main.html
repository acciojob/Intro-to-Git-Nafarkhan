	<p>My intro to Git and colab. To get started, you first need to connect your GitHub or GitLab account to Colab. You can do this by going to “File” -> “Open notebook” -> “GitHub” or “GitLab” and following the prompts. One limitation of this method is that it requires you to have a GitHub or GitLab account.</p>
